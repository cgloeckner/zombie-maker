# Walkers

## REGULAR zombies

- Walkers are just REGULAR FORCES with 1-6 MEMBERS.
- They bite, thus are a MELEE FORCE.
- Walkers are slow, this cannot DASH.
- They have the CARNIVORE ABILITY (p. 30)

## The dead and the living

- Walkers can hear up to 2 PENCILS and may be attracted to a specific spot.
- They smell the living in 1 PENCIL distance.

## Roaming around

If directionless, each FORCE will ROAM: Roll 1d12 as clock die to indicate direction.

## Clustering

Walkers may merge to larger FORCES or cluster groups of FORCES. Clustered FORCED always ROAM together but may be attracted individually.

## Spawning

Use a TIMER to spawn walker REINFORCEMENTS even if there are still walkers around. The undead are vast and countless!
